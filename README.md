# UDP File Transfer System

## Objectives

- Build a program that can send a file from a client to a server using UDP.
- Implement basic error checking and recovery mechanisms, such as sequence numbers or checksums, to
  ensure data integrity.
- Contains additional features such as progress tracking and concurrent file transfers.

## Implementations / Strategies
1. Multiple Single file transfer
2. Concurrent file transfer to a client
3. Concurrent file transfer to multiple clients from the sender
4.

## Global Considerations for all implementations
- Packet ordering
- Error checking (checksum validation)
- Progress tracking - estimated times, timeouts, retransmissions,
